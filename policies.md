### Title IX

Please be aware that all Clark University faculty and teaching
assistants are considered responsible employees, which means that if you
tell us about a situation involving the aforementioned offenses, we must
share that information with the Title IX Coordinator, Brittany Brickman
(titleix@clarku.edu). Although we must make that notification, you will,
for the most part, control how your case will be handled, including
whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to
make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and
have access to the resources you need.

If you wish to speak to a confidential resource who does not have this
reporting responsibility, you can contact Clark’s Center for Counseling
and Professional Growth (508-793-7678), Clark’s Health Center
(508-793-7467), or confidential resource providers on campus (see here
